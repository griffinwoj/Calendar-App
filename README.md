## Description of Calendar Application
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying the starter code. It is designed to run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Task Details
To create this application, you will need to use the Day.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## functionality:

When the planner is opened, the top of the calendar shows the current day.
The user scrolls down to see time-blocks for regular business hours.
The hue of each time-block designates whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When a user clicks into a time-block, they can enter events.
The text for that event is saved in local storage when the save button for a time-block is clicked.
The saved events remain even after refreshing the website.
The following animation serves as an example of how the application functions:
The user adjusts the events by clicking on the slots on the colored calendar.
